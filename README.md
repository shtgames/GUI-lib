# GUI Library

This is a high-level, object-oriented C++11 library for creating and using GUIs in an SFML context, with an intuitive,
easy-to-use API. Each class has been designed such that it can automatically update any text, progress, color and other
properties it may have, without your having to do so manually in the main program loop.

Currently, the library has the following GUI elements included:
  - Icon
  - Mouse-Hover Message
  - Text Area
  - Text Pane
  - Button
  - Check Box
  - Progress Bar
  - Text Field (WIP)
  - Slider (WIP)
  - Scrollable List (WIP)
  
An example demonstrating the usage of those classes not marked as WIP can be found under example in the master branch,
complete with compileable main(), and the image and font resources used therein.
